      <h2>Chapter 1: Meet Me</h2>
      <p class="intro">My name is Lindsey. I'm born and raised in San Diego, California, where I currently reside. I don't care for big city vibes and prefer remote nature. I'm interested in moving to the mountain forests of Tennessee one day.</p>
      <p>Work is a big part of my identity, possibly unfortunately. I've been in healthcare for 11 years and an ICU nurse for 7 years. I'm looking for a better work-life balance and want to leave the healthcare industry in general. This is what lead to my career change to pursue software developing.</p>
      <p>I have a lot of interests/hobbies but I don't think I'm particularly that good at any of them. Drawing is probably my most skilled hobby but I like to write too. I end up playing fantasy-themed video games most of the time. </p>
      <p>My hopes for 2024 is that I maintain some kind of work-life balance with working full time, continuing software developing with Bellevue University and finding opportunities to beef up my resume. I wish to get a software developing job soon after graduating in October 2024 but that isn't too reasonable for a junior developer with no work experience. <span class="sentence">Let's try anyways and good luck to us all!</span></p>
